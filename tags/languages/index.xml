      <description>Whenever there&amp;rsquo;s a discussion about Elixir, it soon becomes apparent that there&amp;rsquo;s still a lot of confusion regarding it&amp;rsquo;s purpose. Some developers have it in their heads that Elixir is merely some crazy new syntax that ex-Rubyists are using to avoid writing Erlang. Well, I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to dispell some of the myths and misconceptions with this blog post.
It&amp;rsquo;s not about syntax, stupid silly! In The Excitement of Elixir, I responded to two of the most well-known criticisms of Erlang from real-world developers now that we have Elixir for comparison.</description>

      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ve been an Erlanger since 2008 and I&amp;rsquo;m the author of a few Erlang projects of varying usefulness and popularity, including Poolboy. Poolboy is used by Basho in Riak, 2600hz in Kazoo, IRCCloud, ChicagoBoss, and other high profile projects.
Get on with it&amp;hellip; What I&amp;rsquo;m trying to say is that I&amp;rsquo;m (hopefully) not an Erlang noob, so with that context in mind I&amp;rsquo;d like to get this off my chest: programming in Erlang sucks.</description>

      <title>JavaScript: The Fastest Dynamic Language?</title>

      <description>I remember programming for the web in the late 90&amp;rsquo;s. JavaScript engines were a lot worse then than they are now, and it was the last programming skill a programmer mentioned. Many programmers didn&amp;rsquo;t even regard the language as a real language, much the same way many of us today scoff when somebody mentions HTML as a programming skill. What many didn&amp;rsquo;t realize, though, is that JavaScript has always been a beautiful language when used correctly.</description>
